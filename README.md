# GradebookC(sharp)

## This is one of my early projects in my C journey.

### The idea of this is to create a console application where the user can input as many grades as they please. 

### Once the grades have been entered the system will work out an average, the highest grade, lowest grade and an average letter grade.

## Enjoy!
